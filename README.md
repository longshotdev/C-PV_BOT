## Special Instructions

Create Ticket (via Command) -> Open Chat room
IDEA: create role that only allows that and adds the user into that role.

Raffle:
On Add (via Command? Restricted) -> Raffle people w/ "tag"
IDEA: i have no clue how this will work currently though the random winner is simple enough.

Anti Slur ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘

System for role
IDEA: I assume he meant a bot to get a role i.e ReactionBot or something along those lines, though what I might do is keep everything in a map

New Drop Incoming -> Tag @everyone

> Webhooks?

Pathway

- 2 days | Ticket System
- 1 day | Anti Slur
